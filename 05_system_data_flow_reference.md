# System Data Flow Reference

## Purpose

Provide a cross-domain flow model that aligns HMI, firmware, and UX understanding.

## End-to-End Control Flow

1. Operator updates effort in HMI
2. HMI serializes Control protobuf
3. HMI sends UDP datagram to firmware control port
4. Firmware decodes and validates Control
5. Firmware publishes control to internal channel
6. Actuation subscriber applies motor effort

## End-to-End State Flow

1. Firmware producers publish partial State fragments
2. Aggregator merges fragments into cached full state
3. Periodic publisher emits snapshot
4. UDP sender transmits snapshot
5. HMI receives and decodes State
6. HMI updates read-only fields and chart buffers

## SMP Flow

1. Operator sends shell or stats action
2. HMI issues SMP request over UDP
3. Firmware MCUmgr handler executes command
4. Response payload returns to HMI
5. HMI renders output in terminal section

## Clock and Sampling Semantics

- Producer stamps are firmware-owned
- HMI-derived Hz is inferred from stamp deltas
- A field can become stale while others continue updating

## Design Implications

- UI should tolerate asynchronous per-field freshness
- UI should separate transport rate from render rate
- UI should support degraded mode when one subsystem stalls

## Migration Note

This data flow must remain stable when moving from Tkinter frontend to web frontend. Backend transport and protocol ownership remains unchanged.
